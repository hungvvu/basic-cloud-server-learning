# basic-cloud-server-learning

This project is mainly for learning and experimenting purposes. Because I need to build a cloud server for another school project, I am using this mini-project to learn more about cloud servers and remote communication.  

**UPDATE:** From 08/03/2023, the cloud development was moved to the main project repository so this repo will no longer have new commits.
